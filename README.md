#Bookmarks Edge Panel

This is an edge panel I made for certain Samsung models (S6, S7, Note Edge). The app allows users to save their favorite bookmarks and open them from the edge panel.

The app uses Fabric/Crashlytics to monitor bugs and other issues customer have. Additionally, Picasso, OkHttp, TextDrawable, and Butterknife are all used as well.
