# Bookmarks Edge Panel

This is an edge panel I made for certain Samsung models (S6, S7, Note Edge, etc). The app allows users to save their favorite bookmarks and open them from the edge panel.

The app uses Fabric/Crashlytics to monitor bugs and other issues customer have. Additionally, Picasso, OkHttp, TextDrawable, and Butterknife are all used as well.  
If you are interested here is the app released in the playstore: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nallapareddy.com.browseredgepanel
